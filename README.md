# Motivation
  I have built applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript and frontend library REACT. This is my first Go web application. 
  The idea was to build something simple, but not too simple. Since I record my workouts at the gym on paper, I wanted to
  have a digital notebook of my workouts. This way I can eliminate paper use as well as have a way to view my progress 
  through the dashboard. Now I will have all my workouts in one place and do not have to worry about searching my paper
  records.
